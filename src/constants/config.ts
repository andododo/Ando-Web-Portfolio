      These projects involved creating user-friendly interfaces, implementing data extraction and conversion functionalities, and producing comprehensive documentation. 
      I also conducted User Acceptance Testing for various systems, including ATC (China) and FADMS, creating detailed user manuals in the process. 
      Additionally, I contributed to improving existing tools, such as enhancing a PPT to PDF converter for better web integration. 
      Throughout these projects, I honed my skills in Python programming, database management, user interface design, and technical documentation, while gaining valuable experience in adapting to corporate IT environments and collaborating with senior developers.`,
