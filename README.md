# Ando Web Portfolio v1.0
This project is a fork of the following template:

https://github.com/ladunjexa/reactjs18-3d-portfolio

## How I forked the template
1. Clone the the repo to your desired directory.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ladunjexa/reactjs18-3d-portfolio
```
2.  Install dependencies on correct *directory* (make sure you have npm installed in your system first).
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Do your changes with the codes.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push -u origin main
```

### Notes
Some parts of the UI is not mobile-optimized. I will fix that soon.
